# The Birthland

## What is it?
It's originally a birthday gift for my girlfriend, but since a lot of people
(a few actually) also wanted to play, I decided to move it to github.

## Updates?
Not very possible at this moment. It takes a lot of time to design the stages
and write out all the dialogues, check the spelling and grammar, etc. 

However, I am aware that a flexible and easy-to-use text adventurer game engine
is actually a great idea, so I might decide to write a brand new one (as this
one is pretty limited) later on. Keep track on my github page or my main page
if you are interested.
